When it comes to store-bought bread, expectations are usually low. You grab something quick, maybe pop it in the oven, and hope for the best.
But sometimes, a humble grocery loaf can actually surprise you.
Today, we're talking about Wegmans Garlic Bread â€” and why itâ€™s earned a permanent spot in my cart.
## Price
$6.00 per loaf

## Value 
*4/5*

Honestly the price has been rising for the past few years. At times coupons are available on the app for small discounts. But overall not bad value, especially considering the economy at the moment.

## Texture: 
*4.7/5*

Excellent crunch on the crust, with a soft, fluffy interior that holds the flavor in well without getting soggy.   
## Flavor: 
*4.5/5*

Real garlic flavor â€” not artificial tasting. It's a nice compliment to a sandwich or even alone. Not overpowering but something that lingers but is there.
## Overall Vibe:
*4.3/5*

For a store bakery garlic bread, Wegmans seriously overdelivers. It doesnâ€™t just pass â€” it genuinely competes with restaurant bread baskets.
## Additional Comments
Eating this bread on the first day is out of this world. I could eat half the loaf easily. After the first day, it goes downhill, but don't worry at all. The bread is *PERFECT* for a sandwich or anything. Just throw it in a toaster for a couple minutes and that crisp bread comes to life.
## Calories
140 Per 1.25 Slices (Weird Amount, but fine)

## Rating: 8.7/10

Would absolutely recommend for solo snacks or sandwiches. Staple bread especially if Wegmans is available for you on the East Coast. 

My personal go to bread. There. I said it.

Enjoy the rest of your day. Whenever you're reading this.
