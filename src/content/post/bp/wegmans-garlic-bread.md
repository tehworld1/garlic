## Price
$6.00

## Value 
4/5
Honestly the price has been rising for the past few years. At times coupons are available on the app for small discounts. But overall not bad value, especially considering the economy at the moment.

## Texture: 
Excellent crunch on the crust, with a soft, fluffy interior that holds the butter well without getting soggy.   
## Flavor: 
Real garlic flavor â€” not artificial tasting. Butter levels are generous but not greasy. Slight herbal notes (probably parsley) add a fresh touch.  
## Overall Vibe:
For a store bakery garlic bread, Wegmans seriously overdelivers. It doesnâ€™t just pass â€” it genuinely competes with restaurant bread baskets.

## Additional Comments
Eating this bread on the first day is out of this world. I could eat half the loaf easily. After the first day, it goes downhill, but don't worry at all. The bread is *PERFECT* for a sandwich or anything. Just throw it in a toaster for a couple minutes and that crisp bread comes to life.

## Rating: 9.1/10

Would absolutely recommend for solo snacks or sandwiches. Staple bread especially if Wegmans is available for you on the East Coast. 

My personal go to bread. There. I said it.

Enjoy the rest of your day. Whenever you're reading this.
