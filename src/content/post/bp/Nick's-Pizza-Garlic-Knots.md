When you think garlic knots, you usually think side dish. Afterthought. Something tossed into the corner of your pizza order.
Nick's Pizza in Bethlehem flips that on its head.
These garlic knots are the main event â€” and theyâ€™re worth every napkin you'll destroy eating them.
## Price
$5.95 for 6

## Location and Reviews on Google Maps
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JZiNaLZBtLrFsLUs8">Nick's Pizza Restaurant, 822 Main St, Bethlehem, PA 18018</a>

## Value 
*4.2/5*

Not insane value, but honestly? Still good. Each of the 6 knots are hefty, packs insane garlic flavor, and satisfying enough to not feel ripped off. It also comes with some marinara sauce, so you can mix it up with some tomatoe flavor. Prices have crept up, but quality has stayed solid.

## Texture:
*4.8/5*

Excellent slight crisp on the crust, with a soft, fluffy interior that holds the flavor in well without getting soggy or stale.   
## Flavor: 
*4.9/5*

Real garlic flavor. NOT artificial tasting. A bit greasy, but not out of the ordinary. Slight sprinking of parsley or similar on top for flavor. Flavorâ€™s strong without being overwhelming. Messy in the best way. (Bring napkins or suffer.) 
## Overall Vibe:
*4.7/5*

For a resturant garlic knot, Nick's is very good. Especially for an area like Bethlehem, PA. Nickâ€™s commits to their garlic knots â€” itâ€™s not an afterthought. If you're local, it's basically an obligation to grab a box once in a while.
## Additional Comments - Best Way to Eat Them
If you donâ€™t inhale them immediately, reheat at 350Â°F for 3â€“4 minutes. Oven only â€” no microwaving if you respect yourself.

## Rating: 9.0/10

Satisfying, real, messy garlic knot goodness. Worth grabbing if youâ€™re nearby and want a quick garlic-fueled snack without regret. They offer great Italian foods as well. Even their cheesesteaks hit. Go try them out, they'll be good no matter what you get.
My personal go to for garlic knots in Bethlehem. it gets my seal of approval.

Enjoy the rest of your day. Whenever you're reading this.
