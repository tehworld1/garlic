## Price
$6.00 per loaf

## Value 
*3.7/5*

Same as the garlic bread: nice crust, soft interior. The olive oil keeps it moist enough, but itâ€™s definitely missing the little flavor punch that makes the garlic version pop.

## Texture: 
*4.7/5*

Excellent crunch on the crust, with a soft, fluffy interior that holds the flavor in well without getting soggy. No different from the garlic bread of theirs.
## Flavor: 
*4.5/5*

Kind of bland.
Not bad â€” just safe, plain, and forgettable. If you like the idea of bread without strong flavors hitting you, itâ€™s perfect. Otherwise, youâ€™re going to miss that garlic goodness real fast.
## Overall Vibe:
*4/5*

Honestly, the only reason to get this is if something is physically stopping you from buying the garlic bread. Allergies? Vampire apocalypse? Out of stock? Maybe then.
## Additional Comments
Toast it with your own garlic butter at home if youâ€™re stuck with it. Thatâ€™s your best shot at redemption.
Otherwise... just buy the garlic bread.
## Calories
140 Per 1.25 Slices (Weird Amount, but fine)

## Rating: 7/10
Perfectly fine, but definitely with less flavor than its sibling.


Enjoy the rest of your day. Whenever you're reading this.
