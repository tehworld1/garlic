Welcome to **Garlic Bread Weekly**! your go-to source for everything buttery, crispy, golden, and glorious.

This blog is dedicated to documenting the best (and occasionally the worst) garlic bread experiences across restaurants, diners, bakeries, and anywhere else carbs are honored.

Every week (or whenever inspiration strikes), I'll post reviews of garlic bread from around the world:
- **Texture** (Crunchy? Fluffy? Cardboard?)
- **Flavor** (Real garlic? Artificial weirdness?)
- **Butter Levels** (Critical.)
- **Overall Vibe** (Would I sell my soul for another piece?)

Whether you're a fellow bread enthusiast, a casual carb consumer, or just someone who respects the greatest culinary invention of all time, you're in the right place.

ðŸ¥– **Welcome aboard.**  
Let's explore the holy world of garlic bread together.

Stay buttery,  
**Patrick**
